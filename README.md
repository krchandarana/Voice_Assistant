# Voice Assistant

  

Jarvis is a comprehensive voice assistant developed in Python, designed to simplify everyday tasks through the power of voice commands. Built to handle a range of functions, Jarvis combines multiple Python libraries and APIs to create an interactive, hands-free experience that feels responsive and intuitive.

This repository contains a voice assistant program, which you can activate and control using various voice commands. 

**The primary file to execute is `jarvis.py`, **not**  `main.py`.**

  

## Prerequisites

  

1.  **Install Python**:

- Download Python from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/python) or from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Add Python to System Path**:

- Ensure Python is added to your system path. By default, Python is usually located at:

```

C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts

```

- To add Python to your path:

- Open **Environment Variables** > **System Variables** > **Path** > **Edit**.

- Add the path to your Python directory containing `ipython.exe` (usually in the folder listed above).

- Click **OK** to save.

  

3.  **Install Chrome Driver**:

- A `chromedriver.exe` file is provided in this repository. If it does not work, download the latest version from [Chrome’s website](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads) or [direct download link](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/129.0.6668.58/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip).

- Extract and place `chromedriver.exe` in the same folder as `jarvis.py`.

  

## Running the Voice Assistant

  

1.  **Set Up Your Environment**:

- Create or use an existing folder, and place all files from this repository into it.

- Add `chromedriver.exe` to the same folder.

  

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

- Open Command Prompt in the folder where you saved the files.

- Run:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

- This will install the required packages (~300-400 MB of data).

  

3.  **Run `jarvis.py`**:

- Open your IDE and execute `jarvis.py` to start the voice assistant.
